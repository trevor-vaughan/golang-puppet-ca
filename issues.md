- [x] Verbosity is not working (not enough debug) — fixed: use `-v 1` for Debug, `-v 2` for Trace; slog.Debug added throughout CA operations
- [x] app immediately dies when running in a container — fixed: server now runs in foreground by default; daemon mode requires explicit `--daemon` flag
- [x] File naming used SHA256 hashes instead of `<subject>.pem` — broke Puppet compatibility and tests
- [x] Missing API endpoints: GET /certificate/{subject}, GET /certificate_revocation_list/ca, GET /certificate_request/{subject}
- [x] FilePermPublic was 0640 (should be 0644)
- [x] Deprecated cert.CreateCRL() replaced with x509.CreateRevocationList()
- [x] Hardcoded CA hostname — now configurable via --hostname flag
- [x] Subject regex not applied in SaveRequest
- [x] CSR not deleted after signing
- [x] GET /certificate_status always returned "signed", never "revoked"
